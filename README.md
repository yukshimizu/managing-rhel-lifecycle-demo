# managing-rhel-lifecycle-demo
This repo includes ansible playbooks for a demo project of automating content management in Red Hat Satellite with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform on AWS EC2.

## Automating Content Management in Red Hat Satellite with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
The goal behind the code is to demonstrate a simple example for automating the periodic publishing of Content Views in Red Hat Satellite and testing those contents before applying to production.

## Assumed demo environment
The assumed environment can be set up on AWS EC2 easily by using playbooks and roles in the [managing-rhel-lifecycle-seup](https://github.com/yukshimizu/managing-rhel-lifecycle-setup) paired repo. 

## Included contents
### Playbooks
|Name     |Description|
|:--------|:----------|
|`publish_cv.yml`|Publish a new version of the configured content view.|
|`promote_cv.yml`|Promote the content view to a life cycle environment.|
|`snapshot_vm.yml`|Snapshot the disk of runnning managed VMs.|
|`update_vm.yml`|Update all packages following the configured content view.|
|`restart_vm.yml`|Restart the running managed VMs.|
|`test_vm.yml`|Test the infrastructure of the restarted VMs.|
|`test_app.yml`|Test the application of the restarted VMs.|

### Group variables
These variables have already been set as follows, corresponding to the setup by [managing-rhel-lifecycle-setup](https://github.com/yukshimizu/managing-rhel-lifecycle-setup). You can adjust them based on your environment.
```
purpose: demo

foreman_organization: My_Organization
foreman_location: Tokyo
foreman_admin_username: admin
foreman_content_view: "RHEL9_SOE"
foreman_activation_key_name: "Demo_Key"

managed_vms_name_prefix: "managed"
aws_region: ap-northeast-1 # adjust with your preference
wp_weblog_title: "DemoSite"
```

## Installation and usage
Assuming the demo environement has been already created by the way of before mentioned and you've also performed `git clone` this repo.

### Automatedly
You can create the demo environment automatedly by running the playbook `create_aac_demo.yml` included in the [managing-rhel-lifecycle-seup](https://github.com/yukshimizu/managing-rhel-lifecycle-setup) paired repo.

To configure automation hub, you must create a credential and add it to the Organization’s Galaxy Credentials field (in this case "Default"). With automation hub, you have access to certified, supported collection i.e., "redhat.satellite".

### Create job templates
Each job template is equivalent to a playbook in this repository. Repeat these steps for each template/playbook that you want to use and change the variables specific to the individual playbook. Please refer to [Ansible Doc](https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/4.5/html/userguide/job_templates.html) for more details.
